# Startup Management Platform

This project lets you manage startups, team members and tasks all in one place. It's built with React on the front end and Express with PostgreSQL on the back end. Drag and drop boards, file uploads and role based access make it easy to keep track of everything.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
After building, you can start the server with:
```bash
npm start
```
